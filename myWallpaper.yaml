# The wallpaper or frieze symmetry group in short IUC notation.
# If the group lattice takes parameters then they follow tagged
# by there names, for example:
#   Group:
#     Name: p1
#     xi: 1.5
#     eta: 2.1
# If the group lattice takes no parameters you can use either
#   Group:
#     Name: p4
# or, just directly:
#   Group: p4
Group:
  name: p3
  # b: 1


# A list of doubly indexed Complex coefficients for the wave function.
# Additional wave packets will be added in order to create the symmetries in
# the specified symmetry group.
Coefficients:
- A(n,m): [1, 0] # 0.75 + 0.25i
  n: 1                 # first index of coefficient
  m: -1                 # second index of coefficient
# - A(n,m): [0.67, -54]
#   n: 0
#   m: -3
# - A(n,m): [0.449, 167]
#   n: 2
#   m: 2
# - A(n,m): [0.301, 151]
#   n: 2
#   m: -4

# Optional field for setting the style, choices are: plain, morph (which takes
# one parameter: cutoff), and blend (which takes as an argument a group object).
# morph will interpolate between the color wheel and its 180 degree rotation,
# leaving the proportion specified by cutoff at the beginning and end.
# Blend interpolates horizontally between two different wallpaper groups.
# If left unspecified type will default to style: plain.
Type:
  style: plain
  # cutoff: 0.1
  # group:
  #   name: p31m

  repeat-length: 280 # used to convert pixel coordinates to real numbers
